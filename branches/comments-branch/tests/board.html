} 
1.e4 
{B00 King's Pawn Opening. The King's Pawn opening move is both popular and logical. It controls the center, opens lines
for both the Queen and the Bishop, and usually leads to an open game in which tactics, rather than slow maneuvering,
predominates.} 
1...e5 
{C20 King's Pawn Game. Black responds symmetrically, making a direct challenge to the central squares.} 
2.Nf3 
{C40 King's Knight Opening. With the possible exception of :2. f4, this is the most logical second move against Black's
symmetrical answer to the King's Pawn. The Knight attacks e5, clears the way for an eventual castle and rests on its best
defensive square.} 
2...Nc6 
{C44 Queen's Knight Variation. Now, when White plays 3.Nc3 (instead of the Ruy Lopez), it's the Three Knight's Game; a
leisurely system.} 
3.Bb5 
{C60 Ruy Lopez (Spanish). This is the Ruy Lopez move. It is designed to maintain long-term pressure on Black's center. If
driven away, the King's Bishop will take up a position at b3 or c2 to focus on a Kingside attack or on the central squares.} 
3...a6 
{C60 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense. This move, popularized by the great Paul Morphy, provides Black greater
flexibility. Black doesn't fear 4.Bxc6 (see the Exchange Variation).} 
4.Ba4 
{C70 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Variation 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4.} 
4...d6 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense. The Modern Steinitz Defense (or deferred)
interpolates 3... a6 so that Black will have the option of cutting off the pin in subsequent complications.} 
5.d4 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
5...b5 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
6.Bb3 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
6...Nxd4 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
7.Nxd4 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
7...exd4 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
8.Bd5 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
8...Rb8 
{C71 Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense.} 
9.Qf3 
{Out of Opening Book. Bc6+ would have been in the Ruy Lopez (Spanish) / Morphy Defense / Modern Steinitz Defense book
opening. Threatens to mate (queen captures
pawn).} 
9...Nf6 10.Bg5 
{Pins Black's knight.} 
10...Be7 
{Frees Black's knight from the pin and clears the way for a kingside castle.} 
11.Bxf6 
{Partially pins Black's bishop at e7 and Black's pawn at g7, forks Black's pawn at g7 and Black's pawn at d4, and
blocks Black's pawn at f7.} 
11...Bxf6 
{Frees Black's pawn at g7 from the pin and protects Black's pawn at g7 and Black's pawn at d4. Black wins a bishop
for a knight.} 
12.Nd2 
{Enables the long castle.} 
12...O-O 13.O-O Bd7 14.Bxf7+ 
{Leads to 14...Rxf7 15.Qa3 b4 16.Qb3 Qe8 17.a4 Be6 18.Qd3 Qc6 19.f4, which wins a pawn for a
bishop. Better is Qg3, leading to 14...Qe7 15.a3 c6 16.Ba2 Qe5 17.f4 Qc5 18.Bb3, which does not exchange any material. This
error did not immediately put white out of the game, but black was able to eventually
mate.}
