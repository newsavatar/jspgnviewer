The project is about showing chess games on your website. Here is an [example](http://tom.jabber.ee/chessblog/2007/12/26/jspgnviewer-06-released/).

Behind the scenes the jsPgnViewer library parses the PGN ([Portable Game Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation)) and draws the graphical board so that visitors can traverse the game.

The library is written in JavaScript and has no other requirements. The library takes the PGN of the chess game and parses it on the fly. No "compilation" as with other libraries, is needed.

The library comes with a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) plugin to enable showing games in your blogs.
